        <pre>
            By the time I followed in my mother’s footsteps,
            Stirred tea leaves have already drenched half lit truths to strangers who spent years squeezing the pulp out of tangerine hopes
            Gently sipping comfort from our own ghosts, dripping wet from three cups that brim with minced rumours

            A frictioned pan sits struggling upon all of the little heat, the salt and sweat marinates mother’s dismissed dreams. Ancestral recipe, as I knew it to be. Its unhinged palette leaves a lasting impression on the guests
            as they dig into the tender legs of family feuds, skinned to the bones
            served fresh on fine China, with knives and forks tearing apart
            women who have been bleeding tears through centuries within four walls.
                        
            I scream at the table, futile like plastic spoons hitting
            the rich mousse, a souvenir of the evening
            that left no secrets undisclosed,
            But mother’s thinly sliced smiles
            Spread over her deep buried happiness;
            only a pinch of chaos dilated her pupils
            as the washbasin fills up once again.
